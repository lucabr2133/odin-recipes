    <h3>Descripccion</h3>
    <p>The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>
    <h3>Ingredientes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup shortening, chilled</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>2 apples - peeled, cored and diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pasos</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Make pastry: Sift flour and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
    <li>Add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Make filling: Place apples in a saucepan. Combine sugar and cinnamon; pour over apples and toss to coat. Cook, covered, in a saucepan on low heat until soft; mash with a fork to make thick applesauce. Set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thick; cut out eight 4-inch rounds with a large cookie cutter.</li>
    <li>Place 1 heaping tablespoon of applesauce in the center of each pastry round. Moisten edges with cold water, fold in half, and press the edge with a fork to seal. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Lower pies carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining pies.</li>
</ol>
